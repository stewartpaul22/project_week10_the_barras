## Totally *not* Gumtree

Goal: Create a web application in Spark with Hibernate/Java back end.
### MVP
You are required to write a web application for a company listing classified ads. The company would like to give users of their site
the ability to create and post adverts to their listings. 
Adverts should require a Title, Description, category and asking price.

Users should be able to:
- Log in to the site to view all adverts posted by other users. (No passwords needed just a username)
- View all adverts in a category.
- Create and post adverts to specific categories.
- Delete their own adverts. 

### Project Extensions

* Post comments on adverts.
* Allow users to mark adverts as favourite so that they can view all favourited ads in one page.
